# Search


### Search Module (@app/core/api/dockerhub_search.py)
- The preferred way of searching, this is a shared method available to all modules
- List a Repo's: container Image Tags, which are needed to view layers' digest

## Search Docker Hub - standalone  (@/app/modules/search/search-docker-hub.py)
- This was made a single standalone script to test component modules in isolation.
- NOT the preferred method
