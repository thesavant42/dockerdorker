# Outstanding Tasks
These are mockups and notes around creating the simulated file system.

### Unless explicitly told to use these files, do not use them or index them.


- [Simulated Filesystem Format](plans\to-do\plan-pseudo-tty-filesystem-formatting\virtualtermnal.md)

- [Fields in FS](plans\to-do\pfs-data-addons\pseudo-filesystem-fields.md)

- [Sample JSON](plans\to-do\pfs-data-addons\file-contents.json)
    - is this still relevant?
    - **Caution: may be obsolete, ask first!**
- [Output](plans\to-do\plan-pseudo-tty-filesystem-formatting\raw-text-output\krafton-jungle.files.txt) from the [standalone file listing script](app\modules\enumerate\list_dockerhub_container_files.py) used for development and testing.
    - standalone script is only meant to be used to generate independant results verifications during development, not for production use.
